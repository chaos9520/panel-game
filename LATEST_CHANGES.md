## Latest Changes
- **3-wides no longer cascade; it has been reverted back to normal.** All of the Challenge Mode stages had to be redone because several stages had become way too easy for their difficulty.
- Modern levels now use one scoring system, and Classic levels use the other.
- Fixed a problem with GPM calculation.
- Training Mode: Made adjustments as to how much and how often garbage is sent in the basic training mode settings. This was done to prevent players from getting instantly overwhelmed.
Reduced the maximum garbage multiplier in overtime from 12 to 4.
# Build Goals
- I need to port over shock panels from garbage from v047 to the refactor.
- Garbage Mode is the main goal I would like to accomplish. This would be very useful for training, but even more so for Challenge Mode stages.
- Server-side (eventually): Implement my Chaos ranking system.
