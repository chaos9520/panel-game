## Latest Changes
- Split up recent changes and the list of changes into separate files.
- Added six panel sets.
## Build Goals
- I need to port over shock panels from garbage from v047 to the refactor.
- Garbage Mode is the main goal I would like to accomplish. This would be very useful for training, but even more so for Challenge Mode stages.
- Server-side (eventually): Implement my Chaos ranking system.
